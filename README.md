# Reverse-Engineering/Malware Analysis
## `‚úã` INTRODUCTION
<p>The repository will serve one purpose: to learn more about reverse engineering and malware analysis. The goal is to start from the basics and build up. This repository will be structured into two specific sections: Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis. The Malware Analysis section will have an example of a required lab configuration to perform analysis along with malware samples for said analysis. The Reverse Engineering section will have samples specifically for reverse engineering. </p>

## `üìã` Structure
- [Reverse Engineering]()
- [Malware Analysis]()


## `‚ùó` DISCLAIMER
<p>This repository may contain potentially dangerous malware. Currently, my goal is to play around with fairly harmless samples purely for learning. As my knowledge grows, more serious malware will be introduced.</p>
