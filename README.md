# Reverse-Engineering/Malware Analysis
## `‚úã` INTRODUCTION
<p>The repository will serve one purpose: to learn more about reverse engineering and malware analysis. The goal is to start from the basics and build up. This repository will be structured into three specific sections: Lab Configuration, Reverse Engineering, and Malware Analysis. Lab Configuration will include the ideal environment one should have to ensure safety and effective analysis. The Reverse Engineering section will have samples mainly for, as the name says, reverse engineering. Same goes for the Malware Analysis section, except it'll also be for dissecting malware.</p>

## `üìã` Structure

## `‚ùó` DISCLAIMER
<p>This repository may contain potentially dangerous malware. Currently, my goal is to play around with fairly harmless samples purely for learning. As my knowledge grows, more serious malware will be introduced.</p>
