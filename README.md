# Reverse-Engineering
## `✋` INTRODUCTION
The repository will serve one purpose: to learn more about reverse engineering. Along with that, it'll consist of malware analysis. Everything will become much more organized as this repository grows. For now, my goal is to start from the basics and build up. 




## `❗` DISCLAIMER
This repository might have dangerous malware in the near future. For now, my goal is to play around with fairly harmless samples purely for learning.
