# Malware Analysis Report: ultima

## Introduction
This sample is only for educational purposes, and since it doesn't do any real harm, it's perfect for practicing malware analysis skills. It was developed by [cr-0w](https://github.com/cr-0w). Before the actual analysis, it's wise to go over some terminology. Malware analysis comprises two types of analyses: static and dynamic. Static analysis occurs when you only want to find out about the technicalities of the malware. For example, its hash or the malware family to which it belongs. There are great tools that give a comprehensive first look at malware, one of which is VirusTotal. If you've followed through the [lab setup](https://github.com/mushy2005/Malware-Analysis/tree/main/Malware%20Analysis), you'll notice that Flare has many useful tools for malware analysis built right into it.

## Initial Details
Before diving into either of the analyses, it's wise to learn about the malware as it seems on the surface. One way to achieve this is by placing the sample into [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) or [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/). Do note that the sample is a locked zip file with a password. To unzip, simply enter the password: `infected`, or you could even do it straight from Flare, like below:<br>

- After unzipping, you'll see these two files:<br><img src="https://github.com/mushy2005/Malware-Analysis/blob/main/Malware%20Analysis/samples/ultima/images/2files.png">
- The only important file is `Ultima.exe.crow`, which is the actual malware. Now, we'll need to find the hashes. We can easily do this by using the `HashMyFiles` application, which comes built-in with FlareVM.<br><img src="https://github.com/mushy2005/Malware-Analysis/blob/main/Malware%20Analysis/samples/ultima/images/hashes.png">
