# Malware Analysis Report: ultima

## Introduction
This sample is only for educational purposes, and since it doesn't do any real harm, it's perfect for practicing malware analysis skills. It was developed by [cr-0w](https://github.com/cr-0w). Before the actual analysis, it's wise to go over some terminology. Malware analysis is comprised of two types of analyses: static and dynamic analysis. Static analysis takes place when you only want to find out about the technicalities of the malware. For example, its hash or the malware family to which it belongs. There are great tools that give a comprehensive first look at malware, one of which is VirusTotal. If you've followed through the [lab setup](), you'll notice that Flare has many useful tools for malware analysis built right into it.
